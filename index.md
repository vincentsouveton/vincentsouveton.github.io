Hello everyone, welcome to my personal academic website! I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. My research interests lie at the boundary of statistics and computer science applied to a wide range of Physics problems.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at CEA. I am interested in the development of Machine Learning models for simulating physical systems and providing uncertainty quantification.

Before that, I was a PhD student at [Laboratoire de Mathématiques Blaise Pascal](https://lmbp.uca.fr/), Université Clermont Auvergne. My thesis deals with the study and development of sampling algorithms (generative models in Machine Learning and non-reversible Monte Carlo methods) with applications in Cosmology. Also, I am a former member of the [Aquila](https://www.aquila-consortium.org/) consortium.
