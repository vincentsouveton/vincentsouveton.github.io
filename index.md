Hello and welcome to my personal academic website!

I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and my research lies at the intersection of statistics and computer science, with applications across a broad range of physics problems. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/), where I focus on developing machine learning models for simulating physical systems and performing uncertainty quantification.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. at [Laboratoire de Mathématiques Blaise Pascal](https://lmbp.uca.fr/), Université Clermont Auvergne, where I explored sampling algorithms, specifically generative models and non-reversible Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, with applications in cosmology. I was also a member of the [Aquila](https://www.aquila-consortium.org/) consortium.

Here is my [GitHub account](https://github.com/vincentsouveton/). I’m developing [NanoTensorLab](https://github.com/vincentsouveton/NanoTensorLab), a sandbox for experimenting with neural sampling, regression, and classification on synthetic data, primarily intended for PhD students and researchers. You can download a [CV](assets/CV.pdf). Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for further information.
