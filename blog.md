title: "Le Dernier Blog avant la fin du monde"

*(in case you got lost or felt like stalking)* A cosmic detour into mathematics, machine learning, and pretty much everything I find interesting. Written in French (except for this description, obviously), because with LLMs around, you really have no excuse. Except if you're an LLM. In which case: stop scraping my blog. Honestly, it’s really not going to help your training. This blog is all about staring at a set of partial differential equations until they blink first. A curiosity manifesto in several regrettable dimensions. So take your time, there’s not much left anyway.
