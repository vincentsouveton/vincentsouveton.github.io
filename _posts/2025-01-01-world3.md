I recently began reading *Cabane* by French author Quentin Abel — a beautifully written and captivating novel. What makes it especially intriguing is that it's inspired by the Meadows Report, a groundbreaking study published in the 1970s.

This connection led me to explore the original report, which presents a mathematical model designed to predict the future of industrial society based on initial conditions and fixed parameters. Specifically, the model tracks five interrelated quantities: population, natural resources, industrial capital, food production, and pollution.

To simulate their evolution, the authors constructed a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations representing the interactions between these variables. Though the model is quite sophisticated, its conclusion is strikingly simple: assuming the trends observed in the 1970s continue — which they largely have — the model forecasts a collapse in all five areas sometime during the 21st century. This wouldn't mark the end of the world, or even of humanity, but it would likely signal the end of industrial society as we know it.

I found the topic so compelling that I’ve started a (GitHub project)[https://github.com/vincentsouveton/world3] to implement a simplified version of the World3 model. It's a great way to understand how sensitive the system is to feedback loops — and how the decline it predicts might indeed be difficult to avoid.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or suggestions!
